# Qt 5 for OS/2

This is a root repository of the Qt software development framework version 5 for OS/2. It tracks ports of all Qt modules applicable to the OS/2 operating system and maintains OS/2 versions of bootstrap and configure scripts necessary to build the Qt framework.

Currently, the following modules have been (or are being) ported to OS/2:

* Qt Base
* Qt Declarative
* Qt SVG
* Qt Tools
* Qt Multimedia
* Qt WebChannel
* Qt WebSockets
* Qt WebEngine

Also, a Qt fork of Chromium (and its build tools, GN and Ninja), which is a "work horse" for Qt WebEngine, has been ported to OS/2.

Please consult to README.md files of individual modules for more information about the ports.

Build instructions are available online in the [github Wiki](https://github.com/bitwiseworks/qt5-os2/wiki/Developers#building-qt).
